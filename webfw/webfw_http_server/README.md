# WebfwHttpServer

A simple http server written in Elixir from scratch with the goals of learning,
and to study and understand how works the web frameworks under the hood.

This http server is conceived as part of own web-framework and organized in
the form of a package (library as an external dependensy)

This is a second iteration of implementation aimed to work with Plug library
(the first implementation intended to work without Plug can be seen via git
history. see commit with hash: `df3f6c2`


## TODOList

- [-] rewrite test to work with Plug (move away from responder to dispatcher)
